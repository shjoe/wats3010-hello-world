  <h2> <i>Prologue</i>: Hello World!</h2>
  <p>This is a very short story.</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <h2>Chapter I</h2>
  <p>There once was a person who signed up for web development classes.</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <h2>Chaper II</h2>
  <p>He was very excited to share knowledge with his classmates and instructors.</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <h2>Chapter III</h2>
  <p>This was his first attempt at writing HTML.</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <h2><i>Epilogue</i>: Farewell for now!</h2>
  <p>This will certainly not be his last crack at HTML.</p>
  <hr></hr>
  <p>I look forward to learning more with you all.</p>
  <p>With warm regards,</p>
